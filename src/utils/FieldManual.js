🔥 How Fire Spreads
Grass ignites easily and burns quickly.
Shrubs spread faster once lit.
Trees (crown fires) spread rapidly tree to tree once ignited.
Structures burn if nearby vegetation catches fire.
Wind and weather amplify spread when risk is HIGH.

Grass: 🚶 Firefighters
Shrub: 🚒 Fire Trucks
Trees: ✈️ Air Tankers, 👷 Hotshots
Structures: 🚒 Fire Trucks, ✈️ Air Tankers
